Please take this ReadMe as definitive instructions to use the Interim Scheduler.

WARNINGS:
- The template is specifically formatted so that it is compatible with the program so you cannot format in ways that are not allowed
- You will lose the colour of the cells in the new schedule when they go through the program.
- Some cells will need formatting in the new schedule.

Format Restrictions:
- You cannot insert or remove columns and rows in the template spreadsheet
- Only delete dates that have NO active jobs scheduled for that date
- When you delete jobs, also delete all the numbers in the RANK row and insert 1 into the first available box, 2 into the next available box. Select the two cells and then drag that little box in the bottom right hand corner of the selection across to the last job

Allowed template changes:
- Add more dates by selecting the bottom date and dragging down that little box in the bottom right hand corner down the cells by the amount of days you would like to add to the schedule
- You can manually insert a job to the end of the job list in the same format
- You can make manual changes to any of the information in the job info rows except for RANK

HOW TO USE:

1. Before opening the program ensure the spreadsheet that you want to reschedule is in the same folder as the program.

2. When asked for the filename include the file extension. For instance:

			Example_Schedule is NOT okay

			Example_Schedule.xlsx is okay

3. When asked for the new name also include the file extension like the example above.

4.When asked if you would like to change the rank or reschedule, the input is case sensitive so the only acceptable inputs are (without quotation marks) RANK, and RESCHEDULE.

5a. RANK will give you the option to move around the priority of a job before then going ahead and rescheduling.
5b. When you choose RANK, you can input the old rank of the job and then input the rank you want the job to have. You do not need to worry about any rank changes caused by this as the program can handle this.
5c. The program will ask you to type Y or N to say whether or not you'd like to change another rank.

6. The program will create a new spreadsheet with the new name you gave it and it will appear in the same folder as the program.
